# Moment-Share

Moment-Share is a web application for sharing textual moments, thoughts or quotes. It allows users to quickly and easily share their moments with friends and the community. The web application was built using React and Supabase was used for authentication and the database.

The main idea behind Moment-Share is to create a space for real conversations. Instead of focusing on likes and popularity, this app is all about connecting with the people you follow and having meaningful exchanges through comments. Itâ€™s designed to let you interact with close friends and community members, making it less about numbers and more about the quality of the conversations.
